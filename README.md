# Overwatch Checklist
A Checklist For Overwatch Events

<b>How it works:</b><br>
1. Open Overwatch_Checklist.pyw<br>
2. Click on "Load Event"<br>
3. Go into the events folder and load the specific event that you want<br>
4. After checking off the ones you have, remember to press save<br>
5. ???<br>
6. Profit<br>


<b>Requirements:</b>
- Python 3.5
 - Might work on 3.x versions earlier but not sure.
 - Doesn't work on Python 3.6 due to pyqt5 not having an available version for it.
- PyQt5
 - ```python -m pip install pyqt5```
- PyYaml
 - ```python -m pip install pyyaml``
- Has only been tested on Windows but I don't see why it can't work on other platforms.
If you have been able to use this on other platforms (or have not), please tell me!

I can't find my specific event, what do I do?
- Come back here and browse the events folder. If this is a new event, it might take a while as I have to make an event file.

I want to make my own event file / wishlist, how can I do this?
- Open "tools/Event_Editor.pyw" and use that to create your file.
Files made from this program should work but you can also try to make one by hand or by another program as this merely follows the YAML syntax.

Have any feedback you would like to give me? I would be happy to hear it!
